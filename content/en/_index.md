## How to Get Started

GC organizations can use LaunchPad for a single experiment with cloud consumption totalling up to $5,000. All experiments must comply with our [Terms and Conditions]({{< globallink "terms-and-conditions" >}}). If you are interested in using LaunchPad, you must apply and meet selection criteria to determine if your experiment is a good fit for this managed environment.

If your experiment is selected, SSC may cover the cost. Future LaunchPad offerings may have associated fees.
